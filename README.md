  Build a C program to input a student’s marks in three subjects (Math, Science, and English). Calculate the average marks and determine the grade using nested if-else statements with safe floating-point comparisons based on the following grading criteria:
    
  A: 90 and above
  
  B: 75 to 89.99
  
  C: 50 to 74.99
  
  F: below 50
  
  The program should display the average marks up to two decimal places and the corresponding grade. 
  
# Date : 20-11-2025
# Aim:
 To build a C program that receives inputs for a student’s marks in three subjects, calculates the average, and determines the grade using nested if-else statements with safe floating-point comparisons.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare float variables math, science, english to store marks of each subject.
### Step 4: 
  Declare a float variable average to store the average marks.
### Step 5: 
  Prompt the user to enter marks for Math, Science, and English.
### Step 6: 
  Read the input marks.
### Step 7: 
  Calculate the average marks using the formula:
   
  average=(math + science + english​)/3.0f
### Step 8: 
  Check if average is greater than or equal to 90.0f

  If yes, print Grade A.

  Else, proceed to Step 9.  
### Step 9:
  Check if average is greater than or equal to 75.0f

  If yes, print Grade B.

  Else, proceed to Step 10.
### Step 10:
  Check if average is greater than or equal to 50.0f

  If yes, print Grade C.

  Else, print Grade F.
### Step 11:
  Stop

  Develop a C program to display the multiplication table of a given number (15) up to 10.
# Date : 20-11-2025
# Aim:
 To develop a C program that prints the multiplication table of the number 15 up to 10 using a for loop.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare an integer variable number and initialize it with 15.
### Step 4: 
  Declare another integer variable i to use as a loop counter.
### Step 5: 
  Use a for loop to iterate from i = 1 to i = 10.
  
  In each iteration:
  
  a. Multiply number by i.
  
  b. Print the result in the format: number x i = result.

  Develop a C program to check whether a given number is prime or not.
# Date : 20-11-2025
# Aim:
 To develop a C program that determines whether an input number is a prime number using a while loop.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare integer variables:
  
  n to store the number entered by the user.
  
  i to use as a counter (initialize to 2).
  
  f as a flag to indicate whether the number is divisible (initialize to 0).
### Step 4: 
  Read the value of n from the user.
### Step 5: 
  Use a while loop to iterate while i <= n-1:
  
  Check if n % i == 0:

  If yes, set f = 1 (number is not prime) and break the loop.
  
  Increment i by 1.
### Step 6: 
  After the loop:
  
  If f == 0, print that the number is prime.
  
  Else, print that the number is not prime.
### Step 7:   
  Stop
